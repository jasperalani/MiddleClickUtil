AutoHotkey script to open hovered folder in file explorer with middle click for Windows OS

### Disclaimer
I did not write this code it is from this [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoHotkey/comments/r73zld/comment/hn0crd3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
), and then I asked ChatGPT to solve a little bug where the first time explorer was opened you had to middle-click twice
